# NestJS - Docker Base Project
I create this repository to simplify me when I need to create new project using NestJS. Please feel free to use this repo, enjoy!

## How to use this
Please read SETUP.MD file

## Dockerize
- I put all docker settings inside folder *.docker*. 
- You can find docker-compose.yml file in *.docker/compose/local* (local mean local environment). If you have another environment, you can simply create another folder like staging or production then put docker configuration file in there.
- Like in *compose* folder, in *file* folder I put my *Dockerfile* in *local* folder. You can do the same thing like you do in *compose* folder, separate every config files in environment-name folder.
